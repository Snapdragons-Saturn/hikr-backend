# Hikr Backend
Hikr is supported by a MongoDB, express, and Node.js backend. 

## Database
We use Mongoose to access MongoDB through Express. Our main data format is that of a hike, or a document detailing the characteristics of an individual hike. We have two identifiers of significance in each document. The first is a unique key generated by Mongo, and the second is a state abbreviation generated by user input. Using these two keys, we can return hikes by regional cluster, a useful feature in allowing any user to view interesting hikes near them.
